# Meta Peace
Providing remote classes and tools for Web3 contributors to bring balance and peace into their communities. 

# Why This Matters?

When we are stressed our sympathetic nervous is activated sending us into fight or flight mode. In this mode, we are worried about resources, scarcity mentality takes over, we think about where and how to get food, our health and our family’s health. We no longer work collectively to find solutions. All we think about are our survival needs, not how society can expand and grow. We are unable to be grounded, centered, creative and function from a loving, compassionate place. Our work is put to a halt, and society begins to digress.

# How We Can Help?

Creating a starting point for people in these remote communities to explore, release and learn in a safe, low risk, anonymous environment while receiving guidance from a professional. By providing yoga, movement, mediation and discussions, we can shift people’s energy and collectively propel communities forward.


For example, a meditation on empathy and compassion would help connect Web3 communities with other people in a compassionate way. When we live our lives on computers it is difficult for us to have empathy towards other humans. We can understand them in an intellectual way, but not through an energetic way. When we practice connecting from our hearts, we begin to live from this place more. We make decisions that include the whole instead of the few, and we create more harmonious interactions.


A session could include 30-45 minutes of movement, 15-30 minutes and breathing and meditation, and 15-30 minutes of discussion on a specific topic. These would take place on a weekly basis, live streamed, recorded to youtube for the accessibility to other community members. The topics would be open for suggestion by making an issue in the GitHub repo, weekly topics would be outlined and drafted prior to the launch of each weekly session.
